A friend should be someone who stands on equal footing with me.
A true friend is one who is not dragged along by another person's dream.
A friend must find his own reason for living, regardless of me.
For me to call a man my friend, he must be equal to me in all respects.
To me, a friend is someone who has their own dream to follow.
Even if that dream should happen to destroy mine.
